There’s no time
for what was left behind
It’s a maiden voyage
after all
All the pretty sinners,
all the medal winners
Overachievers aiming
for their prize
I can feel it coming
Don’t know why you’re
running in the dark
She said,
“I’m looking everywhere,
but I can’t find you
I’m getting closer
like it’s right in front of me
Yeah, I can feel you,
but I cannot see you
I’m reaching out,
reaching out”
I could be dreaming
but I feel so wide awake
A secret yearning
that is deep inside of me
Yeah, I can feel you,
but I cannot see you
I’m reaching out,
reaching out
Yeah, I’m moving forward
to my own be once again
Where I can feel it
calling after me
All the pretty sinners,
all the medal winners
Overachievers aiming
for there prize
I can feel it coming
Don’t know why you’re
running in the dark
She said,
“I’m looking everywhere,
but I can’t find you
I’m getting closer
like it’s right in front of me
Yeah, I can feel you,
but I cannot see you
I’m reaching out,
reaching out”
I could be dreaming,
but I feel so wide awake
A secret yearning
that is deep in inside of me
Yeah, I can feel you,
but I cannot see you
I’m reaching out,
reaching out
You used to tell me that you
wanted us to run away
Didn’t matter, no,
‘cause we’d be okay
Even now that we are
miles apart, so far away
You’re a part of me,
yeah, you light my way
I’m looking everywhere,
but I can’t find you
I’m getting closer
like it’s right in front of me
Yeah, I can feel you,
but I cannot see you
I’m reaching out,
reaching out
I could be dreaming,
but I feel so wide awake
A secret yearning
that is  deep inside of me
Yeah, I can feel you,
but I cannot see you
I’m reaching out,
reaching out
