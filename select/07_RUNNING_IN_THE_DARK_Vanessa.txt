See the moon in the sky
See the passion and close your deep blue eyes
Fly to the high emotions
Like a butterfly, make me right

Lusted paradise and magic harmony
Come on with me
And take me to the sky
With your best imagination

Running in the dark
Out of the visions of my passion
Running in the dark
A lovely spark, the good direction
Running in the dark
Fly to the moon with wild sensations
Running in the dark
A lovely spark
My way and my direction, in the night
Running in the dark
And vision in my mind

All my beautiful dreams
You don't know what I mean in fantasy
Dreaming the secret land
The sweetest ecstasy for your mind

Lusted paradise and magic harmony
Come on with me
And take me to the sky
With your best imagination

Running in the dark
Out of the visions of my passion
Running in the dark
A lovely spark, the good direction
Running in the dark
Fly to the moon with wild sensations
Running in the dark
A lovely spark
My way and my direction, in the night
Running in the dark
And vision in my mind
